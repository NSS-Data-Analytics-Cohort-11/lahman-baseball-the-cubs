LEFT JOIN people
USING (playerid)
LEFT JOIN teams
USING (teamid)
WHERE height IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CONCAT(namefirst,' ', namelast), a.g_all, teams.name

-- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

WITH positions AS 
	(
		SELECT f.playerid, CONCAT(people.namefirst,' ', people.namelast) AS name, po,
		CASE WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
		WHEN pos = 'SS' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '1B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '2B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = '3B' THEN 'Infield'
		WHEN pos = 'P' THEN 'Battery'
		WHEN pos = 'C' THEN 'Battery'
		ELSE 'unknown' END position
	FROM fielding AS f
	LEFT JOIN people
	USING (playerid)
	WHERE f.yearid = '2016'  )

SELECT
	(SELECT SUM(po)
	FROM positions
	WHERE position ilike 'battery') AS battery_po,
	(SELECT SUM(po)
	FROM positions
	WHERE position ilike 'infield') AS infield_po,
	(SELECT SUM(po)
	FROM positions
	WHERE position ilike 'outfield') AS outfield_po
FROM positions;	

-- ANSWER: battery_po = 41424, infield_po = 58934, outfield_po = 29560
-- total for all po is 129918
